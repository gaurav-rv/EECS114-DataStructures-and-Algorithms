Add:
Line 100 code starts 
The worst case in my code would be to add to the very last element.
so the number of iterations would be 
c1+c2+c3+c4(n+1)+c5(n)+c6(n)+c7+c8+c9;

Remove :
Line 151 
The worst case again would be the removing the very last element.

c1+c2+c3(n+1)+c4(n)+c5(n)+c6(n)+c7+c8+c9;


Get:
Similarly getting the last element would take the most iterations,
Line 177
c1+c2+c3+c4(n+1)+c5(n)+c6(n)+c7;
